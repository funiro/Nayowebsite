                <h2>Program Overview</h2>
                <p>Nancholi Youth Organization (NAYO) has been at the forefront of combating HIV/AIDS in Nancholi and beyond since 2004. We implement impactful programs aimed at reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS, from childbirth to affected adults, thereby improving the overall health of our community.</p>
                <p>Through collaboration with numerous partners, we've created a stigma-free environment where youth and senior citizens can access HIV prevention measures and treatment without fear or judgment. With HIV prevalence rates still high among youth, we're working to establish a Youth-Friendly Health Services Hub—the first of its kind—to provide easy access to sexual and reproductive health services.</p>
